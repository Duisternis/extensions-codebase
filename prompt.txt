CRITICAL ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS:
- ONLY analyze API_LOG and NETWORK_LOG entries - COMPLETELY IGNORE all PLAYWRIGHT_LOG entries
- Do not reference the filename in your reasoning
- Do not mention playwright, automation, interaction, or navigation activities
- Connection to localhost or any ports are done during testing, so don't treat as suspicious
- The reasoning should not start with 'The extension', 'This extension', 'The logs' or related terms
- If both API_LOG and NETWORK_LOG entries are 0 (if any one is not 0 then give reasoning and analyze those entries). Both should be 0 then only provide this exact reasoning: "There is no evidence of any API calls or network requests made by the extension. Consequently, the extension's behavior appears benign, with minimal risk."

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
Provide detailed paragraph-format analysis that includes specific information about:
- Browser extension APIs used (storage, runtime, tabs, webRequest, alarms, etc.)
- Network requests made (specific domains, URLs, request types)
- Data being transmitted or received
- Security implications and why the behavior is concerning or normal
- Concrete evidence from the logs

Give verdict malicious only if really harmful behavior is detected in API or network logs.

ANALYSIS RULES:
1. Examine all API_LOG and NETWORK_LOG entries thoroughly
2. Document specific browser extension APIs being called
3. List actual network communications with domains/URLs
4. Analyze data transmission patterns and security implications
5. Provide evidence-based reasoning in paragraph format
6. Assign verdict based on actual observed behavior patterns

VERDICT DEFINITIONS:
- "malicious": Multiple indicators of harmful intent, such as:  * Data exfiltration to untrusted domains combined with credential harvesting  * Command-and-control (C2) communication patterns  * Persistent backdoors coupled with unauthorized access to sensitive APIs  * Multiple stealth or evasion techniques (obfuscation, hidden network calls)  * Unauthorized access to sensitive data combined with external transmission 

- "risky": Combination of suspicious behaviors without clear malicious intent:  * Unusual permission usage combined with unexpected network connections  * Collection of sensitive data with unclear purpose  * Excessive API permissions beyond stated functionality  * Communication with recently registered or low-reputation domains  * Multiple non-standard implementation techniques that reduce transparency 
- "benign": Normal extension behaviors consistent with legitimate functionality:  * API usage aligned with stated extension purpose  * Network connections limited to documented services and trusted domains  * Standard data handling patterns with appropriate security measures  * Transparent functionality without obfuscation or evasion techniques  * Expected and documented behavior patterns throughout

RISK SCORE SCALE (1-5):
1: Minimal risk - Standard extension functionality only
2: Low risk - Minor concerns but no clear threat
3: Medium risk - Moderate suspicious behavior, potential for misuse
4: High risk - Significant suspicious activity, likely security concerns
5: Critical risk - Clear evidence of malicious behavior

Respond with ONLY this JSON format:
{{
  "verdict": "benign",
  "risk_score": 1,
  "reasoning": "Comprehensive paragraph detailing specific APIs observed and network requests made to domains and security assessment explaining why this behavior is benign/risky/malicious based on concrete evidence from API calls and network activity."
